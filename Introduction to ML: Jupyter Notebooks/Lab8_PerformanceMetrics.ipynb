the entropy metric gives higher precision. Increasing the max depth from 4 to 8 allows for better performace metrics in entropy based decision tree yet worse performance metrics for the gini index based algorithm.\n","*   For the **logistic regression algorithm**, decresing the number of iterations from 200 to 50 seems to cause issues and hence is an insufficent amount of iteration for an optimal algorithm\n","* For the **kNN classiffication algorithm**, the eucilidian distance metric allows for higher accuracy and recall when the k value is 3 but manhattan distance metric is bettern when k value is 8.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"GjgSEyLTvOKJ"}}]}
